[*] FitVids [object] removal. (props Ulrich Pogson)
    @see: https://github.com/davatron5000/FitVids.js/pull/90

[+] Functions to check whether or not All in One SEO and WordPress
    SEO are activated. In: /includes/functions.php and header.php
    for WP SEO. If AIOSEOP, we will remove the Responsive's wp_title
    filter. And use wp_title() only for WP SEO. Pretty nice stuff.

[*] Theme Options info buttons. Changed "Donate Now" to more visible
    blue color and removed Responsive classes.
