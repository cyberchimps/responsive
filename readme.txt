    Responsive Features:
-------------------------------------------------------

- Theme Options
From here you can customize your above the fold
section such as your headline, sub-headline and content.
Also your call to action button text and URL. As well as
an image on the right. Image can be just that or even YouTube
or any other video too.

- Widgets
Well you're in luck my friend, Responsive offers 9 of them.
And yes 3 boxes in your home.php are widgets as well.

- Page Templates
There is plenty of that. 9 Templates are very much self-explanatory
once you're on done with the content on your page, go to Page Attributes
on the right and choose any available Template.

We Have:
Blog (full posts), Blog Summaries, Content/Sidebar, Sidebar/Content,
Content/Sidebar Half, Sidebar/Content Half, Full Width Page, even a
landing page in case that you don't want anything else but the clean
white design and your logo, perfect for PPC or anything else. There's
also a sitemap Template.

- Menus
Oh boy, we love menus and that's why we decided to give you little bit
more than what you're probably use to. Responsive offers 4 of them
One at very top, second in header, third just after the header, we like
to call that sub-header menu and the fourth one is all the way down in
footer area.

What's great about this is that the other 3 are kind of on-demand,
activate when needed, if not oh well...
