== License ==

Yes I know, but we have to say a few words about that.

The Theme itself is nothing but 100% GPL3. See license.txt for further details. There are however some parts of this Theme which are not GPL, however they are GPL-Compatible and that's still good.

See headers of JS files for further details.
